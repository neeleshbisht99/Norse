**Norse** is a lightweight and easy-to-use deep learning framework with **neural architecture search**.

Norse aims to provide developers with an automated service for end-to-end neural network architecture search, enabling developers to obtain better models with fewer hyperparameter configurations. For more detailed usage of Norse, please refer to related [documents]

At this stage, Norse enables you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs in most operating systems. **In the future, GPUs will be added to the minimalist architecture**.

# Features
* Lightweight and portable to smart devices.
* Support online learning.
* Automatic neural network architecture search.
* Cloud-friendly. Based on C++11, it supports most operating systems and compilers.

# Installation
* C++ version:

```
cd Norse
cmake .
sudo make install
```
